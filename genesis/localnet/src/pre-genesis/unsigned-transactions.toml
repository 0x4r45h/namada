# This file contains hand-written unsigned transactions for localnet with:
#
# - MASP account
# - Faucet account that allows anyone to withdraw limited amount of tokens
# - 2 established accounts for "Albert" and "Bertha"
#
# Note that 2 more localnet user accounts "Christel" and "Daewon" are left as
# implicit accounts, so their tokens are kept in the accounts derived from their
# keys used in `balances.toml`.
#
# This file is used to produce `signed-transactions.toml` with
# the `sign-genesis-tx` command.

# Topic

A topic is string and a encoding that describes this sub-network. In a topic all
intents must use the exact same encoding. That encoding is known by matchmakers
so it can match them.  Whenever a node subscribes to a new topic it informs all
connected nodes. Each of them tries to subscribe to it and continue the
propagation of that new topic. With this itâ€™s easy to create new topics in the
intent gossip network and inform others.

To prevent spamming of topic creation, each node can define a topic filter. This
filter prevents subscribing to a topic that the user is not interested in. This
filter is a combination of a whitelist, a regex expression, and a maximum limit
of subscribed topics.

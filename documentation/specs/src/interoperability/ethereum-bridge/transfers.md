# Transfers

## Namada Validity Predicates

There will be three internal accounts with associated native validity predicates:

- `#EthSentinel` - whose validity predicate will verify the inclusion of events 
from Ethereum. This validity predicate will control the `/eth_msgs` storage 
subspace.
- `#EthBridge` - the storage of which will contain ledgers of balances for 
wrapped Ethereum assets (ERC20 tokens) structured in a 
["multitoken"](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/issues/1102) hierarchy
- `#EthBridgeEscrow` which will hold in escrow wrapped Namada tokens which have 
been sent to Ethereum.

### Transferring assets from Ethereum to Namada

#### Wrapped ERC20

The "transfer" transaction mints the appropriate amount to the corresponding 
multitoken balance key for the receiver, based on the specifics of a 
`TransferToNamada` Ethereum event.

```rust
pub struct EthAddress(pub [u8; 20]);

/// Represents Ethereum assets on the Ethereum blockchain
pub enum EthereumAsset {
    /// An ERC20 token and the address of its contract
    ERC20(EthAddress),
}

/// An event transferring some kind of value from Ethereum to Anoma
pub struct TransferToNamada {
    /// Quantity of ether in the transfer
    pub amount: Amount,
    /// Address on Ethereum of the asset
    pub asset: EthereumAsset,
    /// The Namada address receiving wrapped assets on Anoma
    pub receiver: Address,
}
```

##### Example

For 10 DAI i.e. ERC20([0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)) to `atest1v4ehgw36xue5xvf5xvuyzvpjx5un2v3k8qeyvd3cxdqns32p89rrxd6xx9zngvpegccnzs699rdnnt`
```
#EthBridge
    /erc20
        /0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
            /balances
                /atest1v4ehgw36xue5xvf5xvuyzvpjx5un2v3k8qeyvd3cxdqns32p89rrxd6xx9zngvpegccnzs699rdnnt 
                += 10
```

#### Namada tokens

Any wrapped Namada tokens being redeemed from Ethereum must have an equivalent amount of the native token held in escrow by `#EthBridgeEscrow`.
The protocol transaction should simply make a transfer from `#EthBridgeEscrow` to the `receiver` for the appropriate amount and asset.

### Transferring from Namada to Ethereum

To redeem wrapped Ethereum assets, a user should make a transaction to burn 
their wrapped tokens, which the `#EthBridge` validity predicate will accept.

Once this burn is done, it is incumbent on the end user to
request an appropriate "proof" of the transaction. This proof must be
submitted to the appropriate Ethereum smart contract by the user to
redeem their native Ethereum assets. This also means all Ethereum gas costs 
are the responsibility of the end user.

The proofs to be used will be custom bridge headers that are calculated
deterministically from the block contents, including messages sent by Namada and
possibly validator set updates. They will be designed for maximally
efficient Ethereum decoding and verification.

For each block on Namada, validators must submit the corresponding bridge
header signed with a special secp256k1 key as part of their vote extension.
Validators must reject votes which do not contain correctly signed bridge
headers. The finalized bridge header with aggregated signatures will appear in the
next block as a protocol transaction. Aggregation of signatures is the
responsibility of the next block proposer.

The bridge headers need only be produced when the proposed block contains
requests to transfer value over the bridge to Ethereum. The exception is
when validator sets change. Since the Ethereum smart contract should
accept any header signed by bridge header signed by 2 / 3 of the staking
validators, it needs up-to-date knowledge of:
- The current validators' public keys
- The current stake of each validator

This means the at the end of every Namada epoch, a special transaction must be
sent to the Ethereum contract detailing the new public keys and stake of the
new validator set. This message must also be signed by at least 2 / 3 of the
current validators as a "transfer of power". It is to be included in validators
vote extensions as part of the bridge header. Signing an invalid validator
transition set will be consider a slashable offense.

Due to asynchronicity concerns, this message should be submitted well in
advance of the actual epoch change, perhaps even at the beginning of each
new epoch. Bridge headers to ethereum should include the current Namada epoch
so that the smart contract knows how to verify the headers. In short, there
is a pipelining mechanism in the smart contract.

Such a message is not prompted by any user transaction and thus will have
to be carried out by a _bridge relayer_. Once the transfer of power
message is on chain, any time afterwards a Namada bridge process may take
it to craft the appropriate message to the Ethereum smart contracts.

The details on bridge relayers are below in the corresponding section.

Signing incorrect headers is considered a slashable offense. Anyone witnessing
an incorrect header that is signed may submit a complaint (a type of transaction)
to initiate slashing of the validator who made the signature.

#### Namada tokens

Mints of a wrapped Namada token on Ethereum (including NAM, Namada's native token)
will be represented by a data type like:

```rust
struct MintWrappedNam {
    /// The Namada address owning the token
    owner: NamadaAddress,
    /// The address on Ethereum receiving the wrapped tokens
    receiver: EthereumAddress,
    /// The address of the token to be wrapped 
    token: NamadaAddress,
    /// The number of wrapped Namada tokens to mint on Ethereum
    amount: Amount,
}
```

If a user wishes to mint a wrapped Namada token on Ethereum, they must submit a transaction on Namada that:
- stores `MintWrappedNam` on chain somewhere - TBD
- sends the correct amount of Namada token to `#EthBridgeEscrow`

Just as in redeeming Ethereum assets above, it is incumbent on the end user to
request an appropriate proof of the transaction. This proof must be
submitted to the appropriate Ethereum smart contract by the user.
The corresponding amount of wrapped NAM tokens will be transferred to the
`receiver` on Ethereum by the smart contract.

# Ethereum Smart Contracts

The set of Ethereum contracts should perform the following functions:

- Verify bridge header proofs from Namada so that Namada messages can
  be submitted to the contract.
- Verify and maintain evolving validator sets with corresponding stake
  and public keys.
- Emit log messages readable by Namada
- Handle ICS20-style token transfer messages appropriately with escrow &
  unescrow on the Ethereum side
- Allow for message batching

Furthermore, the Ethereum contracts will whitelist ETH and tokens that
flow across the bridge as well as ensure limits on transfer volume per epoch.

An Ethereum smart contract should perform the following steps to verify
a proof from Namada:

1. Check the epoch included in the proof.
2. Look up the validator set corresponding to said epoch.
3. Verify that the signatures included amount to at least 2 / 3 of the
   total stake.
4. Check the validity of each signature.

If all the above verifications succeed, the contract may affect the
appropriate state change, emit logs, etc.

# Namada Bridge Relayers

Validator changes must be turned into a message that can be communicated to
smart contracts on Ethereum. These smart contracts need this information
to verify proofs of actions taken on Namada.

Since this is protocol level information, it is not user prompted and thus
should not be the responsibility of any user to submit such a transaction.
However, any user may choose to submit this transaction anyway.

This necessitates a Namada node whose job it is to submit these transactions on
Ethereum at the conclusion of each Namada epoch. This node is called the
__Designated Relayer__. In theory, since this message is publicly available on the blockchain,
anyone can submit this transaction, but only the Designated Relayer will be
directly compensated by Namada.

All Namada validators will have an option to serve as bridge relayer and
the Namada ledger will include a process that does the relaying. Since all
Namada validators are running Ethereum full nodes, they can monitor
that the message was relayed correctly by the Designated Relayer.

During the `FinalizeBlock` call in the ledger, if the epoch changes, a
flag should be set alerting the next block proposer that they are the
Designated Relayer for this epoch. If their message gets accepted by the
Ethereum state inclusion onto Namada, new NAM tokens will be minted to reward
them. The reward amount shall be a protocol parameter that can be changed
via governance. It should be high enough to cover necessary gas fees.

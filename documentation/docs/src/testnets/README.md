# Namada Testnets

Testnets on Namada serve the purpose of allowing users on the internet to test the latest features of the protocol. Beware of bugs :warning: :ant: ! Pest control can be reached through any of our socials, and we greatly appreciate any bug reports :eyes: :airplane_arriving: 

Testnets are released on a fortnightly cycle (every other Tuesday). Sometimes changes are large, sometimes they are small. The [Github changelog](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/.changelog) will specify exactly what changes have been made in between versions.

The instructions to join the latest running testnet can be found [HERE](https://hackmd.io/WDhESkCeSWepuki1F1scxg)

The block explorer is currently in development. The latest version can be found at [namada.world](https://namada.world/)

We much appreciate any feedback, which we would gladly appreciate through either [Twitter](https://twitter.com/namadanetwork), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/namada), or [Github](https://github.com/anoma/namada/issues). 

We look forward to seeing you there!

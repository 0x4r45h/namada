# Namada Testnets

Testnets on Namada serve the purpose of allowing users on the internet to test the latest features of the protocol. Beware of bugs 🚸 🐜 ! Pest control can be reached through any of our socials, and we greatly appreciate any bug reports 👀 🛩 

Testnets are released on a fortnightly cycle (every other Tuesday). Sometimes changes are large, sometimes they are small. The [Github changelog](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/.changelog) will specify exactly what changes have been made in between versions.

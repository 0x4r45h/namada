# Anoma ledger prototype

## Quick start

The ledger currently requires that [Tendermint version 0.34.x](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) is installed and available on path. [The pre-built binaries and the source for 0.34.8 are here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.8), also directly available in some package managers.

There are 2 types of accounts: basic and validator. The accounts have string addresses, basic prefixed with `'b'` and validator with `'v'`. Accounts can have some balance of unspecified currency Â¤ (type `u64`).

The transaction code can currently be built from [tx_template](../tx_template) and validity predicates from [vp_template](../vp_template), which is Rust code compiled to wasm.

The transaction template calls `transfer` function from the host environment (Anoma shell) with some hard-coded values for the transfer source, destination and amount (this is temporary until we have more complete storage API for transactions).

The validity predicate template receives the `transfer` data and checks that the transfer's amount > 0.

The validity predicate is currently hard-coded in the shell and used for every account. To experiment with a different validity predicate, build it from the template and restart the shell.

```shell
# Install development dependencies
make dev-deps

# Run this first if you don't have Rust wasm target installed:
make -C ../tx_template deps

# Build the validity predicate and transaction wasm from templates, at:
# - ../vp_template/vp.wasm
# - ../tx_template/tx.wasm
make build-wasm-scripts

# Build Anoma
make

# Build and link the executables
make install

# Run Anoma daemon (this will also initialize and run Tendermint node)
make run-anoma

# Reset the state (resets Tendermint too)
cargo run --bin anomad -- reset-anoma

# Submit a transaction with a wasm code
cargo run --bin anomac -- tx -c ../tx_template/tx.wasm

# Watch and on change run a node (the state will be persisted)
cargo watch -x "run --bin anomad -- run-anoma"

# Watch and on change reset & run a node
cargo watch -x "run --bin anomad -- reset-anoma" -x "run --bin anomad -- run"

# run orderbook daemon
make run-gossip

# run orderbook daemon with rpc server
cargo run --bin anomad -- --rpc run-gossip

# Submit an intent (need a rpc server)
cargo run --bin anomac -- intent "data"

# Format the code
make fmt
```

## Logging

To change the log level, set `ANOMA_LOG` environment variable to one of:
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `trace`
